Heart disease is a serious health problem which may affect large number of people across the world. As a result, detecting a heart condition at an early stage will be beneficial to treatment. The number of persons with heart disease is rapidly increasing, necessitating the development of a system that can detect heart disease more easily. The presence or absence of disorder is determined by the patient’s smoking status. 
The cardiac disease system can identify patients who are high-risk and define the most important variables in Cardiovascular patients but also build a model so that they can distinguish between them easily and understandably. 
The Machine Learning algorithms applied and compared based on the characteristics like age, Chest ache, Blood Pressure (BP), Sex, cholesterol and heartbeat. The main focus of this paper is to develop a basic machine learning model to enhance the diagnosis of the heart condition in the right manner. 
The different techniques such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine are applied for machine learning and achieve the better results in this work.

Conclusion:This project aimed to develop predictive models for heart disease using various machine learning algorithms, leveraging a dataset that includes several medical attributes. The comprehensive process included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of six different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K- Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Key Findings and Insights:
1.  Data Preparation and EDA:
o         The dataset was successfully cleaned and preprocessed, addressing any missing values and ensuring that all features were suitable for model training.
o         EDA provided valuable insights into the distribution of features, the balance of the target variable, and the relationships between features and the target. Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps were instrumental in understanding the data.
2.  Model Building and Evaluation:
o         Each model was trained and evaluated using the same dataset, allowing for a fair comparison of their performance.
o The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy, followed closely by the Support Vector Machine. These models demonstrated robust performance, making them suitable candidates for predicting heart disease.
o The evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix, provided a comprehensive understanding of each model's performance.
This project demonstrates the power of  machine  learning in  medical diagnostics, specifically in predicting heart disease. By systematically applying and evaluating multiple  machine  learning  algorithms,  we  identified  models  with  high  predictive accuracy. The insights gained from this project underscore the importance of data- driven approaches in healthcare and pave the way for future advancements in predictive analytics for heart disease. Ultimately,  the  successful  implementation  of  these  models  could  lead  to  earlier detection,  timely  intervention,  and  improved  patient  outcomes,  highlighting  the transformative potential of machine learning in healthcare.
